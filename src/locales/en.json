Since this first edition with modest ambitions and mainly intended for the locals, the association decided to redouble its efforts to put on the map of France, Isère and its commitment to the development of eSport.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",

It was then that Chartreuse Gaming signed its most ambitious event with 98 players spread over League Of Legends, Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Rocket League, and a global prize of 3500€.",
      "4": "This last edition confirms the volunteers in their wish to impose themselves on the regional scene and then on the tricolour scene. In order to achieve this, the association decided to move to Saint-Martin-d'Hères, in the Grenoble metropolis."
